            <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
            <p>When handling items SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13, proper procedure is vital.
                The items are not permitted to be moved off-site unless accompanied by two Level 4 security personnel.
                Under no circumstances should any other component of SCP-004 be taken through SCP-004-1.
                The effects of doing so are as yet unknown, and the current cost of experimentation makes further
                research impractical.
                Should any of the objects contained within SCP-004-1 breach containment, or the facility be breached,
                the keys must be brought inside and the door closed prior to activation of Site 62’s on-site warhead.
                Unauthorized removal of keys from the testing area is grounds for immediate termination.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Level 1 clearance is required for basic access to SCP-004-1;
                Level 4 clearance is required for use of SCP-004-2 to -13.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>SCP-004 consists of an old wooden barn door (SCP-004-1) and a set of twelve rusted steel keys (SCP-004-2
                through SCP-004-13).
                The door itself is the entrance to an abandoned factory in [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Space-Time Anomalies</h4>
            <p>SCP-004 seems to propagate spatiotemporal anomalies. Personnel leaving the facility report losing time.
                Those who have been in the site for weeks insist that they had only been in the facility for several
                days,
                and records of work completed and supplies consumed support their claims.
                Other temporal anomalies involve SCP-004-2 through -13, especially the reappearance of SCP-004-CAS01 and
                SCP-004-CAS02 exactly ██ years after using SCP-004-██.
                ████████████████████ has been assigned to investigate all aspects of these time anomalies.
                Spatial anomalies include the impossibly large dimensions of the area opened by SCP-004-7.
                Similarly, the 2003 blackout incident suggests that there exists an alternate plane of existence within
                the same space that Site-62 occupies.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Additional Notes</h4>
            <p>Testing on SCP-004 reveals that ten of the keys open SCP-004-1 on a dimension where the laws of physics
                and topology are significantly different than those of our home dimension. Test subjects meeting these
                hostile conditions are torn apart, their body parts deposited in various locations, only three of which
                have been verified to be on Earth. Material deposited at two of these points appears immediately;
                material deposited at the third appears exactly ██ years into the future. The other seven locations are
                currently unknown.</p>
            <p>Current testing focuses on two avenues of research. The first is finding ways to survive SCP-004’s
                hostile topologies. The second [DATA EXPUNGED] suggest that SCP-004-2 through -13 may open doors other
                than SCP-004-1.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Appendix A: Mental Health Effects of SCP-004-12</h4>
            <p>All Class D personnel using SCP-004-12 return in a catatonic state, unable to speak. Some may have enough
                energy left to try to claw out their eyes. Of the 16 subjects, only 4 have survived. Only one has
                regained speech, following long-term psychotherapy. He was able to tell the psychiatrist that he saw a
                massive green creature, so large that much of its body extended beyond his field of view. He reported
                innate fear and sudden recognition, “as if it were something buried deep in [his] primal fears,” and
                forced implantation of “incomprehensible” memories. Subject displays acute anterograde and retrograde
                amnesia.</p>
            <h4>Appendix B: Additional Information</h4>
            <br>
            <p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-004-14 SCP-004-14</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 09/02/1950</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Origin of Object:</b> Object was discovered elsewhere in factory area, in the previously undiscovered
                manager's office.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Description:</b> Object appears as a large, unvarnished wooden box. The box may be unlocked by the
                "safe" key, SCP-004-7, as well as five of the "unsafe" keys (see Document SCP-004-1).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Upon unlocking SCP-004-14 with SCP-004-7, the box opens automatically on hinges. The volume of the space
                inside is precisely five times greater than the outer dimensions imply. Items placed within while the
                lid remains open do not affect the weight or any other properties of the box. When the lid is closed and
                locked, however, all items inside vanish irretrievably. Personnel locked inside the box are also
                irretrievable, although losing personnel in this fashion appears to affect significantly the dreams
                experienced by [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
